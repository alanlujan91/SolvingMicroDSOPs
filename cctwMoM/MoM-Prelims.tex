  As a preliminary to our solution, define $\hEnd_{t}$ as
  end-of-period human wealth (the present discounted value
  of future labor income) for a perfect foresight version of the problem
  of a `risk optimist:' a consumer who believes with perfect confidence
  that the shocks will always take the value
  \PermShkOn
  {1, $\TranShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\TranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$ and $\PermShk_{t+n} = \Ex[\PermShk]=1~\forall~n>0$.}
  {1, $\TranShkEmp_{t+n} = \Ex[\TranShkEmp]=1~\forall~n>0$.}
  The solution to a perfect foresight problem of this kind takes the
  form\footnote{For a derivation, see \cite{BufferStockTheory}; $\MPCmin_{t}$ is defined therein as the MPC of the perfect foresight consumer with horizon $T-t$.}
