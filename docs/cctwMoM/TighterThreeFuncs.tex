  As $m_{t}$ approaches
  $-\ushort{m}_{t}$, $\Lo{\koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})$ converges to zero, while as $m_{t}$
  approaches $+\infty$, $\Lo{\koppa}_{t}(\mu_{t})$ approaches $1$.

  As before, we can derive an approximated consumption function; call it
  $\Alt{\Lo{\cFunc}}_{t}$.  This function will clearly do a better job approximating the consumption
  function for low values of $\mNrm_{t}$ while the previous approximation will perform better
  for high values of $\mNrm_{t}$.

  For middling values of $\mNrm$ it is not clear which of these
  functions will perform better.  However, an alternative is available
  which performs well.  Define the highest gridpoint below $\mtCusp$ as
  $\bar{\check{\mNrm}}_{t}^{\#}$ and the lowest gridpoint above $\mtCusp$ as
  $\ushort{\hat{\mNrm}}_{t}^{\#}$.  Then there will be a unique interpolating
  polynomial that matches the level and slope of the consumption function
  at these two points.  Call this function $\tilde{\cFunc}_{t}(\mNrm)$.

  Using indicator functions that are zero everywhere except for specified intervals,
