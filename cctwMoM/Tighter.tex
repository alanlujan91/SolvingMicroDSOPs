  \cite{BufferStockTheory} derives an upper limit  $\MPCmax_{t}$ for the MPC as $m_{t}$
  approaches its lower bound.  Using this
  fact plus the strict concavity of the consumption function yields the
  proposition that
  \begin{equation}\begin{gathered}\begin{aligned}
        \cFunc_{t}(\ushort{m}_{t}+\aboveMin \mNrm_{t}) & < \MPCmax_{t} \aboveMin \mNrm_{t}.
      \end{aligned}\end{gathered}\end{equation}

  The solution method described above does not guarantee that
  approximated consumption will respect this constraint between gridpoints, and a failure to
  respect the constraint can occasionally cause computational problems in solving
  or simulating the model.  Here, we
  describe a method for constructing an approximation that always
  satisfies the constraint.
