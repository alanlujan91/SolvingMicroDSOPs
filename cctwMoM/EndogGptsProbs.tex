Unfortunately, this endogenous gridpoints solution is not very well-behaved outside the original range of gridpoints targeted by the solution method.  Though other common solution methods are no better outside their own predefined ranges.  %Figure~\ref{fig:ExtrapProblem} demonstrates the point by plotting the amount of precautionary saving implied by a linear extrapolation of our approximated consumption rule (the consumption of the perfect foresight consumer $\cFuncAbove_{T-1}$ minus our approximation to optimal consumption under uncertainty, $\Alt{\cFunc}_{T-1}$).  Although theory proves that precautionary saving is always positive, the linearly extrapolated numerical approximation eventually predicts negative precautionary saving (at the point in the figure where the extrapolated locus crosses the horizontal axis).
